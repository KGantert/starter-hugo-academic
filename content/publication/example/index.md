  Non-clearing goods markets are an important driver of capacity utilization and
  total factor

  productivity (TFP). The trade-off between goods prices and household search effort is central

  to goods market matching and therefore drives TFP over the business cycle. In this paper, I

  develop a New-Keynesian DSGE model with capital utilization, worker effort, and expand

  it with goods market search-and-matching (SaM) to model non-clearing goods markets. I

  conduct a horse-race between the different capacity utilization channels using Bayesian

  estimation and capacity utilization survey data. Models that include goods market SaM

  improve the data fit, while the capital utilization and worker effort channels are rendered less

  important compared to the literature. It follows that TFP fluctuations increase for demand

  and goods market mismatch shocks, while they decrease for technology shocks. This pattern

  increases as goods market frictions increase and as prices become stickier. The paper shows

  the importance of non-clearing goods markets in explaining the difference between technology

  and TFP over the business cycle.

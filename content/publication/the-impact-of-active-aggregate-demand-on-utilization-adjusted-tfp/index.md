abstract: Non-clearing goods markets are an important driver of capacity
  utilization and total factor productivity (TFP). The trade-off between goods
  prices and household search effort is central to goods market matching and
  therefore drives TFP over the business cycle. In this paper, I develop a
  New-Keynesian DSGE model with capital utilization, worker effort, and expand
  it with goods market search-and-matching (SaM) to model non-clearing goods
  markets. I conduct a horse-race between the different capacity utilization
  channels using Bayesian estimation and capacity utilization survey data.
  Models that include goods market SaM improve the data fit, while the capital
  utilization and worker effort channels are rendered less important compared to
  the literature. It follows that TFP fluctuations increase for demand and goods
  market mismatch shocks, while they decrease for technology shocks. This
  pattern increases as goods market frictions increase and as prices become
  stickier. The paper shows the importance of non-clearing goods markets in
  explaining the difference between technology and TFP over the business cycle.

abstract: Is the Phillips curve dead? I propose a simple New-Keynesian framework
  with goods market search-and-matching to link inflation and monetary policy to
  the capacity utilization rate. This approach allows to include active
  aggregate demand and goods market characteristics. I can derive a ”Capacity
  Utilization New-Keynesian Phillips Curve” with a slope that depends on the
  level of goods market search-and-matching frictions. It decreases in markets
  where aggregate demand becomes more important for market matching. The model
  can replicate the joint behavior of capacity utilization and macroeconomic
  aggregates reasonably well. The goods market search-and-matching modeling
  approach allows to include a large variety of household and goods market
  matching characteristics like demographics, sentiment, or labor market status
  and breaks it down to one parameter.
